;W[mi]C[### 23rd Fujitsu Cup

**April 14 2010, Tokyo, Japan: 23rd Fujitsu Cup Quarter Finals**

*Gu Li 9d (black) vs Lee Sedol 9d*

The opening up to Black 25 was popular at the time.

White 28 was a nice move to take sente.

White 50 and White 52 were Lee's fighting style of play, and Black started to attack both White's bottom and right side.

Black 75 and Black 83 were severe attack, but White managed the situation well up to White 94.]

;W[eg]C[Black 107 was a sharp tesuji, but White 108 and White 110 were a good combination to escape.

White 118 and White 120 were good sequence, and there was bad aji left in the top right corner.

Cutting at Black 133 was severe, but White managed to save his group up to White 144.

Black went all out with Black 155, but White 158 was a good move to take sente, and the game was practically decided with White 164.

White 178 was questionable, and Black caught up with Black 185.

However, White was still leading the game with the ko from White 192.]

Eventually, White had more ko threats, and Black couldn't have any chances to catch up.

**264 moves: White won by resignation.**])
